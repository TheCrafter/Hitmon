## <a name="usage"/> Usage

When you open the executable a small icon appears in system tray. Hitmon now counts your keyboard hits. Every once in a while it will notify you that you reached a certain amount of hits (for example 10.000). Additionally, you can view your current hit count at any time by clicking on the icon and choosing the appropriate option. To shutdown Hitmon just choose exit from menu.
